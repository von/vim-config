=My key binding strategy=

[[/index|Back to Index]]

*Command* is used for default Mac keybindings (closing applications, changing
spaces, saving, etc.)

*Option (Alt)* is used for HammerSpoon (hammerspoon/init.lua) and other
Application hotkeys such as iTerm

*Control* is used for tmux (tmux/tmux.conf), in particular C-Space is my prefix.

*Shift* is used in conjunction with the above.

*Shift-arrows* is used to change panes, using special configuration in vim
and vifm to change either the pane within vim/vifm or tmux appropriately.

*fn* seems to be hard to use directly and I don't use it.

Function keys are controlled by Karabiner-Elements and HammerSpoon

  * System Preference / Keyboard / select "Use all F1, F2, etc keys as standard
    function keys"
  * karabiner/karabiner.json has the configuration Karabiner-Elements (editing
    Preferences doesn't seem to persist)
  * Hammerspoon (specifically hammerspoon/config/hotkeys.lua) then maps
    F7,F8,F9 to controlling Google Music
